# calendar
Sqlite query for generating a calendar or date table, and holiday calculation including gregorian easter. Examples for US, EU, NL holidays, celebrations and special days. Export query to output 'column' textfiles, that only works as intented from commandline example. Tested with "SQLite version 3.49.1 2025-02-18" on windows 11.

With a (optional) sqlite viewer like "sqlitespy" you can execute sql code and see the TEMP tables in memory.
